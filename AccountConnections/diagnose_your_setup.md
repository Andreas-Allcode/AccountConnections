# Diagnosis for accountconnections.vly.site LinkedIn OAuth

## ✅ Redirect URI Check - PASSED
Your code generates: `https://accountconnections.vly.site/`
Your LinkedIn setting: `https://accountconnections.vly.site/`
**Status: CORRECT** ✅

Since the redirect URI is correct, the issue is likely one of these:

## Most Likely Issues (in order):

### 1. Environment Variables Problem
**Symptoms:** Server error during token exchange
**Check:** 
- Is `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` set correctly in your Convex environment?
- Any extra spaces or characters?
- Is it the correct secret from your LinkedIn app?

**Action:** Add the debug handler from `linkedin_debug.ts` to see the exact error

### 2. LinkedIn App Configuration
**Check these in your LinkedIn Developer App:**
- [ ] App is in "Live" mode (not Development)
- [ ] "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" product is enabled
- [ ] App has `openid`, `profile`, and `email` permissions
- [ ] No conflicting redirect URLs

### 3. Authorization Code Issues
**Symptoms:** "Invalid grant" or "Invalid authorization code"
**Causes:**
- Authorization code expired (10-minute limit)
- Code already used (one-time use only)
- Network delay between authorization and token exchange

## Immediate Next Steps:

### Step 1: Get Detailed Error Information
1. Copy the content from `linkedin_debug.ts` into your Convex functions
2. Temporarily replace your `handleLinkedInCallback` with `handleLinkedInCallbackDebug`
3. Try the OAuth flow again
4. Check your Convex logs for detailed error information

### Step 2: Verify LinkedIn App Settings
Go to your LinkedIn Developer App and screenshot/verify:
- Products tab: "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" status
- Auth tab: Redirect URLs (should show `https://accountconnections.vly.site/`)
- Settings tab: App status (Development vs Live)

### Step 3: Check Environment Variables
In your Convex dashboard, verify:
- `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` is set and matches your LinkedIn app
- `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` is set and matches your LinkedIn app  
- `SITE_URL` is set to `https://accountconnections.vly.site`

## Expected Debug Output

When you run the debug handler, you should see something like:

**If it's working:**
```
=== TOKEN EXCHANGE RESPONSE ===
Status: 200
Body: {"access_token":"...", "token_type":"Bearer", ...}
```

**If there's an error:**
```
=== TOKEN EXCHANGE RESPONSE ===
Status: 400
Body: {"error":"invalid_client","error_description":"Invalid client credentials"}
```

The specific error message will tell us exactly what's wrong.

## Quick Test

You can also test your LinkedIn app configuration by:
1. Going through the OAuth flow
2. When you get redirected back with the error, check the browser's developer console
3. Look at the Network tab to see if there are any failed requests
4. Note the exact error message shown to the user

Let me know what the debug handler shows, and we can pinpoint the exact issue!

# LinkedIn Scraping Demo Flow

## ðŸŽ¯ **What We Built**

A home page company search that demonstrates the value of Account Connections by showing users exactly who they can reach through their LinkedIn network.

## ðŸš€ **User Experience Flow**

### **Step 1: Home Page Search (Logged Out)**
1. User visits the home page
2. Sees: "Who has connections at..."
3. Enters a company name (e.g., "Google", "Microsoft", "AllCode")
4. Clicks "Find My Connections"

### **Step 2: Results Display**
- Shows "ðŸŽ¯ 150 People You Can Reach at [Company]"
- Lists employees with:
  - Name (hidden if logged out: "J*** S****")
  - Title and company
  - Location
  - **"X LinkedIn connections at [Company]"** (key value prop)
  - 1st degree connection badge
  - Message/View Profile buttons

### **Step 3: Value Demonstration**
- User sees they can reach 150+ people at the target company
- Realizes the power of their LinkedIn network
- Wants to connect but buttons prompt: "Sign in to connect with people"

### **Step 4: Conversion**
- User clicks sign up/sign in to access the connections
- Gets full names and active connection capabilities
